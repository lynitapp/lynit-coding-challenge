# Lynit Coding Challenge

## Purpose:
Aim of this test is three fold:
- evaluate your coding abilities
- judge your technical experience
- understand how you design a solution


## Instructions

In this challenge you will create a Full Stack Web Application for managing book data. The user should be able to view, edit, create, and delete books. Books should be filterable by the author and genre.
